# Bridging Huna and Gateway: A Hybrid Practice Protocol

**Version 0.1 - Community Testing Phase**

---

## Introduction

This document proposes a structured integration of Serge Kahili King's Huna practices with Robert Monroe's Gateway meditation system. The goal is to formalize King's conceptual exercises into reproducible Gateway-style protocols that practitioners can adopt and refine.

**Prerequisites:**
- Familiarity with Gateway Focus 10 (mind awake/body asleep state)
- Basic understanding of Monroe's Release and Recharge technique
- Conceptual grounding in the Huna lono/ku (conscious/subconscious) distinction

## Core Huna-Gateway Concepts

### The Lono and Ku (King, Chapter 5)

In Huna philosophy:
- **Lono** (conscious mind) directs awareness and makes decisions
- **Ku** (subconscious mind) holds memory, controls the body, and generates emotions
- Effective practice requires conscious cooperation between these aspects

### Three Communication Methods from King

**1. Memory Probe ("Treasure Hunt")**
A practice where you ask the ku to surface memories—either pleasurable or painful—to understand subconscious patterns and preferences.

**2. Symbol Talk**
The ku communicates through spontaneous symbolic imagery. You pose a question inwardly and observe the first image that appears, which represents the ku's perspective on that issue.

**3. Backtalk**
The ku responds to conscious intentions through words, physical sensations, or images when you state specific claims about your abilities, rights, desires, and determination.

## Proposed Protocol: Memory Probe Trust Sandwich → Release and Recharge

### Rationale

This protocol combines King's Memory Probe with Monroe's Release and Recharge in a structured "trust sandwich":
1. **Positive memories first** - establish safety and rapport with the ku
2. **Negative memories** - vulnerable work happens in trusted space  
3. **Return to positive** - end on an uplifting note
4. **Release and Recharge** - process and release the collected negative material

This cycle builds trust progressively: the ku learns that surfacing pain leads to relief, not re-traumatization.

### The Four-Phase Practice

**Phase 1: Positive Probe (5-10 minutes in Focus 10)**

*Setup:*
- Enter Focus 10 using your preferred Gateway method
- Set clear intention: "Ku, show me memories that bring you joy"

*Practice:*
- Observe without directing—let memories surface spontaneously
- Notice patterns: themes, time periods, sensory qualities
- Fully experience the positive emotional resonance
- Thank the ku for sharing

**Phase 2: Negative Probe/Trash Collection (2-3 minutes initially, scale up over time)**

*Setup:*
- Maintain Focus 10 state
- Set intention: "Ku, show me memories that carry pain or need release"

*Practice:*
- Observe without re-experiencing intensely—maintain F10 detachment
- Notice what surfaces without judgment (this is the "trash collection")
- Acknowledge each memory as it appears
- Build the "heap" of material ready for release

*Progressive Trust Building:*
- **Early sessions:** Keep negative phase SHORT (2-3 minutes, 1 memory only)
- **Later sessions:** Gradually approach equilibrium with positive phases (5-7 minutes)
- The lono must earn deeper access to the ku through proven competence with surface material

**Phase 3: Positive Return (5-10 minutes in Focus 10)**

*A/B Test Opportunity:*
- **Track A:** Revisit joyful memories from Phase 1 (reinforcement)
- **Track B:** Request new joyful memories (emergence)

*Practice:*
- Re-establish safety and positive emotional state
- Complete the "trust sandwich"
- Observe which approach (A or B) feels more supportive for you

**Phase 4: Release and Recharge (standard Gateway protocol)**

*Setup:*
- Transition directly from Positive Return
- The ku has identified and surfaced material ready for release

*Practice:*
- Use Monroe's Release and Recharge structure, work through the heap one at a time:
  - Acknowledge one item from the "heap"
  - Experience briefly without attachment
  - Consciously release using your preferred method (energy bar tool, balloon visualization, etc.)
  - Repeat until the heap has been cleared
- Complete with Recharge phase—fill cleared space with fresh energy

**Completion Indicator:**

When the ku starts producing trivial negative memories ("that sandwich last week," "minor Tuesday annoyance"), you've cleared significant material. This signals natural completion, not failure.

## Standalone Practices: Symbol Talk and Backtalk

### Symbol Talk in Focus 12

*When to use:* Decision-making, understanding situations, receiving guidance

**Protocol:**
1. Enter Focus 12 for broader awareness
2. Pose a specific question to the ku
3. Request response in symbolic form: "Show me a symbol for [situation]"
4. Observe the first image/sensation that appears—no interpretation yet
5. Ask ku for clarification if needed: "Show me more about this"
6. Record the symbol immediately upon return
7. Interpret later in normal consciousness

**Key principle:** Symbols reveal current ku feelings/beliefs, not predictions. They show present inner state, which you can then work to change.

### Backtalk in Focus 10 or 12

*When to use:* Testing subconscious support for goals, identifying blocks

**Protocol:**

State each of these four statements slowly, 3-5 times, with space between for inner responses:

1. "I have the **power** (ability) to [your intention]"
2. "I have the **right** (I deserve) to [your intention]"  
3. "I have the **desire** to [your intention]"
4. "I have the **will** (determination) to [your intention]"

**Observe responses:**
- Positive (encouraging words, good feelings, positive images) = good ku support
- Negative (criticism, argument, bad feelings, muscle tension, negative images, or NO response) = blocks to address

**Note:** If backtalk is in words, you'll understand specific beliefs. Use this information with other Huna/Gateway techniques to address resistance.

## Request for Community Input (RFI)

We invite Gateway practitioners to test this protocol and provide feedback on the following:

### A/B Test - Positive Return Method
- Did you use **Track A** (reinforcement - revisiting Phase 1 memories) or **Track B** (emergence - requesting new positive memories)?
- Which felt more supportive and trust-building for you?

### Trust Development Timeline
- How many sessions before the ku offered deeper material?
- Did you experience resistance? How did it manifest?
- At what point did trivial complaints emerge (completion indicator)?

### Protocol Timing
- What positive/negative phase ratios worked best for you?
- Did you keep negative phases short initially and scale up gradually?
- How long until reaching equilibrium between positive and negative phases?

### Integration with Gateway Practice
- Did this enhance your existing Gateway work?
- Any unexpected interactions with other Monroe exercises?
- Did Focus 10 state aid the memory probe process?

### General Experience  
- Was the overall practice net positive, neutral, or draining?
- Would you continue this practice? Why or why not?
- What modifications would you suggest?

## Notes and Disclaimers

**This is experimental integration work.** These protocols synthesize King's conceptual framework with Monroe's structured methodology. Results may vary significantly between practitioners.

**Not a replacement for professional help.** If traumatic material surfaces that feels overwhelming, please seek appropriate professional support.

**Flexibility encouraged.** Adapt timing, phrasing, and structure to suit your individual practice. The core principle—building trust through the positive-negative-positive-release cycle—remains constant.

**Version tracking.** This is v0.1. Future iterations will incorporate community feedback and refinement.
